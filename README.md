# slack_archive_unroller
 Unrolls a slack archive into a big text file for future reference.


 If you have a Slack Archive downloaded in Zip file form, you can extract it and then run this program to get it all in one markdown text file.


 On running the `unroller.py`, you will be asked for three inputs:
 - `Slack name:` This will be the header at the top of your output file.
 - `Path to archive:` The system path to the abovementioned extracted Zip file.
 - `Output file name:` The name for the output file, which will have '.md' extension added to it. By default, this file will be spit out wherever you run `unroller.py`.
